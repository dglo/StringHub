/**
 * Provides the base RAPCal implementation.
 *
 * Maintains a list of Isochron instances that span a continuous period
 * of time.
 *
 * Each Isochron is defined by a pair of sequential time calibrations which
 * define the relationship between the DOM, DOR and UTC clocks for an
 * interval of time.
 *
 * For a particular DOM clock value, the isochron that contains it is considered
 * the best source for UTC time reconstruction.  For DOM clock values that do
 * not have a bounding isochron, the nearest isochron is used for time
 * reconstruction by extrapolating the frequency variation of its interval.
 * Clients are advised to implement strategies that maximize the use of
 * bounding tcals. Note that this may be unavoidable for data generated prior
 * to the initial tcal, or for data acquired after the final time calibration.
 *
 * This class is designed for subclasses to define a fine time correction
 * strategy utilizing the RAPCal waveforms.
 *
 *
 * Design Notes:
 *
 * This class is not thread safe. Multi-threaded clients may wrap instances
 * with SynchronizedRAPCal to support multi-threaded use.
 *
 * Updates are infrequent in relation to dom clock reconstructions. Defensive
 * and optimization calculations are preferred at the point of update.
