/**
 * Wraps a data processor with a configurable threading model.
 *
 * This class respects two design goals:
 *
 *    Support low latency data acquisition.
 *    Encapsulate and hide the ugly complexity of asynchronous processing.
 *
 *
 * Design Notes:
 *
 * Exception conditions in processing code that were synchronous with respect
 * to data acquisition in the single threaded design are now asynchronous.
 * By convention, these exceptions have been used to halt acquisition and
 * processing and transition the DataCollector to a ZOMBIE state.
 *
 * In the case of the threaded processor the only recourse is to log the error
 * condition and shutdown the processor. The DataCollector will ultimately
 * observe this condition in a subsequent call (as a DataProcessingException)
 * and respond by terminating itself to a ZOMBIE state.  This is likely to
 * occur in a call to process(), but can happen in any call including
 * shutdown().
 *
 * Since we are operating asynchronously, it is possible for the DataCollector
 * to initiate shutdown prior to observing an error condition in the processing
 * thread. This race is resolved in forceShutdown() method. The reason it is
 * resolved here (and not in shutdown) is to let a processing exception
 * preempt a graceful shutdown.
 *
 * Although we use a single threaded "ThreadPool" executor, it should be
 * possible to use a thread pool with thread/channel affinity that is shared
 * by all processors on the hub.  This would reduce thread count and context
 * switching.
